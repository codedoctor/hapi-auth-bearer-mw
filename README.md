HAPI plugin that supports bearer token security using our identity store.

1. PLEASE NOTE THAT SIGNIFICANT PARTS OF THE CODE HAVE BEEN USED FROM ANOTHER NPM MODULE (hapi-auth-bearer by Jordan Stout)

2. ALSO, THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS

3. BEARER TOKEN SECURITY IS NOT REALLY THAT SECURE - USE WITH CAUTION AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
