HAPI plugin that supports bearer token security using our identity store.

1. PLEASE NOTE THAT SIGNIFICANT PARTS OF THE CODE HAVE BEEN USED FROM ANOTHER NPM MODULE (google it, don't have the link handy)

2. ALSO, THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS

3. BEARER TOKEN SECURITY IS NOT REALLY THAT SECURE - USE WITH CAUTION AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
